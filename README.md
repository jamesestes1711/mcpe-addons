# Minecraft Pocket Edition Addons
Here, you can download minecraft addons and mods that Wilco and I have made and if you can't find a mod, check Wilco's github first: http://wilco375.github.io/index.html before you request mods, texture packs, and addons. To add the addons, you must have Minecraft: Pocket Edition version 1.0 and up (included in my apk repo: https://github.com/jamesestes1711/apkdatabase). Download the zip addon and use MCPEMaster to install it. To install mods, you have to use MCPE versions 16.x and below. You can use BlockLauncher or MCPEMaster to install. For texture packs, any MCPE version will work. You have to use MCPEMaster to add texture packs for all versions 1.x and up.
